# ValenceHLK

The "DataHLK" file contains the data set that was created for the presentation "HLK with Prepositional Phrases in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Tanakh", held on the Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in Boston (MA) on November 19, 2017. 

This data set includes all occurrences of the Hebrew verb /HLK/ with prepositional phrases introduced by /L/ and /B/ in both the BHS and the Dead Sea Scrolls 1QM and 1QS.

The data in the first four columns was taken from the database of the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer (ETCBC, VU Amsterdam). 

The other three columns were coded by hand. Column E, mode of interpretation, and column F, semantic role, were coded by me. The Hebrew language type column (G) follows the division that is described by Ian Young, Robert Rezetko, and Martin Ehrensv√§rd as the traditional consensus (in their book Linguistic Dating of Biblical Texts, Vol. 1, p. 11).
